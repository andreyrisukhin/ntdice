The goal of ntdice is to simulate, visualize, and generate sets of non-transitive dice. 

## Grime Dice

One impressive set of non-transitive dice was discovered by Dr. James Grime. This set has several cycles:
- Alphabetical: blue, magenta, olive, red, yellow
- Length (increasing): red, blue, olive, yellow, magenta
- Reverse Length (decreasing): magenta, yellow, olive, blue, red

Each of the dice in this set has six faces.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ntdice from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ntdice")
```
To view vignettes, run the following code:

``` r
devtools::install_github("andreyrisukhin/ntdice", build_vignette = TRUE, build_opts = c())
library(ntdice)
# Use this to view the vignette in the ntdice HTML help
help(package = "ntdice", help_type = "html")
# Use this to view the vignette as an isolated HTML file
utils::browseVignettes(package = "ntdice")
```

## Coming Soon
Features coming soon include:
- simulate_roll(dice_a, dice_b, trials)
- Plotting simulation results, visualizations
- Intelligent dice selection
- Generating new sets of Non-Transitive Dice
- More famous sets of Non-Transitive Dice (efron dice)
- More uses for get_win_matrix()
